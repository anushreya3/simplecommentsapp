## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build a React comments app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete comments and replies. The app should have the following features:

- Responsive design for optimal layout on different screen sizes
- Hover states for all interactive elements
- Save the current state in the browser using localStorage
- Use data from a local `data.json` file to populate content on the first load

## My process

### Built with

- React
- useState and useEffect hooks
- localStorage
- SASS

### What I learned

During the development of this app, I learned how to:

- Use React hooks to manage state
- Store data in the browser using localStorage
- Create, read, update, and delete comments and replies
- Create a responsive design for different screen sizes

### Continued development

Some areas for future improvement include:

- Implementing a more sophisticated state management system (e.g., Redux)
- Incorporating a back-end to store data more securely
- Enhancing the UI/UX with more interactivity and better design

### Useful resources

- [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The official React documentation is an invaluable resource for understanding and working with React components and hooks.
- [localStorage on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - This MDN article provides a great introduction to localStorage and how to use it in web applications.
